      <h2 class="article-header">TRANSPARENCY IN OUR WORK</h2>

      <p>
        ISDA contracts are prepaid by our clients at a flat rate in reasonable quantities. This payment structure removes the complex, exorbitant payment structures global law firms use that incentivise delay in negotiation and execution. Our lean team of derivatives
        documentation negotiators are focused on the efficient execution of contracts. We use the same provisions as global law firms, but negotiate for a fraction of the price.
